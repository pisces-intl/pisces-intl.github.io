Same with uncertainty involving CISA's public catalogue of exploited vulnerabilities.\n\n\"I think states are going to have to provide some kind of support there,\" he said. \"That could be in the form of establishing internships with all of the schools that are teaching cybersecurity and deploying interns out into rural healthcare to watch logs, look for signs of compromise. Things like that\" (see: [Are Efforts to Help Secure Rural Hospitals Doing Any Good?](https://www.healthcareinfosecurity.com/are-efforts-to-help-secure-rural-hospitals-doing-any-good-a-27669)).\n\nAs of Friday, a CISA spokesperson in a statement to ISMG said the agency \"continues to provide services and resources that help healthcare organizations improve their cybersecurity and build resilience.\"\n\n\"In close collaboration with interagency and healthcare sector partners, we offer a range of services and tools on our [Cybersecurity Toolkit for Healthcare and Public Health](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cybersecurity-best-practices/healthcare),\" CISA said.\n\n\"In addition to guides and best practices, this toolkit includes enrollment in our free vulnerability scanning service and CISA regional team contact information for guidance and assistance,\" CISA said.\n\nIn this audio interview with Information Security Media Group (follow link above photo for audio), Hamilton also discussed:\n\n- How funding cuts to Medicaid and other federal programs may impact rural healthcare providers;\n- Other low-cost programs and offerings to help rural healthcare entities boost their cybersecurity posture;\n- Evolving regulatory issues in the healthcare cybersecurity space to watch closely.\n\nHamilton has more than 30 years of experience in technology and management. He previously was the co-founder and CISO of security firm Critical Insight and is also the former CISO for the City of Seattle. He is also the former vice chair of the Department of Homeland Security's State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Government Coordinating Council.\n\n\n","ogImage":{"url":""},"coverImage":""}},"__N_SSG":true}
