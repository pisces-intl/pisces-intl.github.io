The collector plugs into the span port. Ideally, rack space will be provided and, during provisioning, certain information must be collected regarding internal addressing, wire speed, and details of the internet connection."},{title:"How much work is involved in setting up the monitoring solution?",text:"The collector is pre-configured using information collected in a scoping conversation, and the configuration information is provided on a bootable removable storage device (USB thumb drive). Following simple instructions as the device boots, configuring the collector requires approximately 15 minutes. The collector is then plugged into the edge switch into the port with copied (spanned) traffic, and data flow is confirmed."},{title:"What type of data is pulled from the network for analysis?",text:"Intrusion detection system alerts (very similar to anti-virus alerts) and packet headers (metadata).

Students do not have access to the on-premise collector nor is it reachable from the internet."},{title:"Do students go through a background check?",text:"Students are required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, but no background check is required. Because students are handling metadata likely subject to public disclosure, there is negligible risk to personally identifiable or regulated information. In addition, the collectors are one-way so data can only flow to the Cyber Range for analysis. Students cannot reach back to the community sharing data."},{title:"Are international students involved?",text:"International students are members of these classes and subject to the same requirements."},{title:"How secure is the data pulled from customer networks?",text:"Metadata and intrusion detection system alerts are stored for approximately 90 days, if necessary for forensic purposes. Data are stored at a participating university, and the data center must maintain security standards for physical security of the facility, network-level access control, time-limited access authorization for students, and data center security monitoring."},{title:"How long will my jurisdiction receive this service?",text:"Typically, for jurisdictions with fewer than 150 employees, no-cost contracts are for 3-year terms.

Additionally, students will primarily work on university-secured computers or with computers that meet university-secured and PISCES-secured requirements. Students are provided waivers to commit they will, to the best of their ability, maintain data confidentiality. The non-release of information also typically falls under university ethics policies and subjects students to university review if not adhered. The university policies can be provided to municipalities for full transparency."},{title:"How do we maintain accuracy of student results?",text:"Several lines of checks to accuracy from students. Students are trained to detect anomalies in header data. Upon detecting something anomalous, they verify that this is, in fact, a credible threat. Upon determining a credible threat is present, students report to the professor who is a trained professional in the field. The professor reviews the report and makes a determination, based on this evaluation, to pass this information along to the municipality."},{title:"How do I get involved?",text:"All inquiries about partnering your community or municipality with a university should be directed to Steve Stein, Executive Director of PISCES, who is responsible for connecting PISCES to local communities.
