Intersect Insight will identify opportunities for partnerships among international universities, cybersecurity agencies, and community organizations interested in adopting the successful PISCES model.  Enhancing the capabilities of the cybersecurity workforce and safeguarding critical infrastructure must become a global priority. Although our initial focus is in Europe and the U.K., inquiries from all geographies are encouraged.
 
A key advantage of the PISCES model is flexibility to adapt its business model and curricula to conditions specific to the needs of potential partners.   Intersect Insightâ€™s global presence will support the implementation and management of those partnerships.
