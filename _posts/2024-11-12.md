We bring students the cyber workforce experience before they enter the workforce. Our real-world hands-on cybersecurity challenges are designed around and inspired by the most in-demand technical cyber work roles and the tasks those work roles must be able to competently perform to be successful. Our challenges embrace the variety, complexity, and difficulty of cyber work, taking place in fully virtualized business environments, providing challenge scenarios and details through fictional co-workers, and pushing students to learn and problem-solve on the fly. Through our in-house developed cyber range platform and wide variety of hands-on cyber challenges, we aim to provide the most realistic experiences to students, for free, at scale, and year-round, while also generating useful assessment data about their knowledge, skills, and abilities for educators.

 

This platform is freely available to US-based academic users only. Educators must sign up for Curator accounts initially on our website and be granted access before they can grant their studentsâ€™ access.
