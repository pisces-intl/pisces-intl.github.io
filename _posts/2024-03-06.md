Associate Professor Michael Tsikerdekis will spend 6 months in Greece in 2025 to research implementing a version of the Public Infrastructure Security Cyber Education System ([PISCES](https://pisces-intl.org/)) at the [University of Macedonia](https://www.uom.gr/en), Thessaloniki, Greece, working with professor [Ioannis Mavridis](https://www.uom.gr/en/mavridis). 

PISCES is a U.S.-based non-profit corporation and program supported by various organizations such as the Department of Homeland Security, state governments, and industry partners to provide free security monitoring to municipalities and boost the education of cybersecurity students.
 
 
The goal is to understand the challenges of jump-starting such a program and provide training and support. 
This also includes studying how students learn to perform as cybersecurity analysts when monitoring real-world traffic. Research on how to effectively prepare the new generation of cybersecurity professionals to address the cybersecurity job gap and build bridges across the two countries is a larger long-term objective of this project.
 
The [Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/), which is the U.S. governmentâ€™s flagship program of international educational and cultural exchange, sends approximately 800 American scholars and professionals each year to approximately 130 countries. 
In these nations, they deliver lectures and/or engage in research across a diverse range of academic and professional disciplines.
