The city of Beckley has said it’s still working to identify what data has been affected and how much of an impact that the incident has had on its system, which helps govern a population of roughly 17,000 people. Officials have not declared if it’s a ransomware attack or which group is behind the incident.

“We are working diligently to investigate the source of the incident, confirm the incident’s full scope and impact, and identify whether data may be impacted,” the statement reads.

The cyberattack is one of the first against local governments in 2024, following a year full of cyberattacks targeting all levels of government, including many local governments across the U.S.
