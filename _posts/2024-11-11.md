Try Cyber is a web application for cyber work role discovery and exploration. It provides the cyber curious free access to short 15-minute hands-on micro-challenges, where participants can experience a day-one internship as one of the ten supported NICE Framework cyber work roles partnered with a fictional mentor. Try Cyber is sponsored by and developed in collaboration with the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/).
